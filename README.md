A small app intended to retrieve and visualize data from Flickr. Build
as a coding challenge.
It is deployed on Heroku, you can access it: [here](https://flickrr.herokuapp.com/)

I sincerely hope it is not judged by its looks, because I am doomed :)

### Technologies used
- Ruby
- PostgreSql

### Libraries used
- Sinatra
  - Extremely lightweight web framework written in Ruby, alternative of
Rails.
- Flickr
  - A thin wrapper around the Flickr API. Pretty much all it does is
performing the http requests
- Will paginate
  - Paginating library
